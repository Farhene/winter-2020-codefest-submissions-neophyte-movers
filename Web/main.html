                In this educational game platform, you will start by learning the terms.
                The first button, after you click start, is to learn the climate and energy-type terms.
                The second button is there to test you on your climate terms. Lastly, the third button is to test
                you on the energy-type terms.  Each test will consist of several questions
                related to the terms.  You will have 30 seconds to answer each question. Good Luck!
